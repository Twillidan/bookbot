# bookbot
Boot.dev guided project: Bookbot

This was a nice first project, made some additional improvment over what the course material requiered.
You can use the --order flag to select if you want "alpa" or "num" ordering.
And removed the hardcoded path, it's now an argument, so it should be able to read any textfile the user can access.
Example use.
python3 main.py books/test.txt --order num
